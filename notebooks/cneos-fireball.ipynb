    "A shooting star is a common term for a meteor and form bright trails of light that are often bright enough to be visible during the day. A \"fireball\" is a term for expectionally bright meteor that enters the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds. A meteor that form fireballs can be over one meter long. A \"bolide\" typically refers to a fireball that breaks up in the atmosphere. These objects are tracked by the [Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/) and information about the Peak Brightness, Velocity, and Joules of energy radiatated can be retrieved from CNEOS via an API"

    "There are many ways to gather data. Science and research entities like NASA are constantly producing and collecting data. As a result, attempting to collect and display live data can be difficult since new data is always being added. An API (Application Program Interface) is a live service that can be quered at the time that code is run to collect all the most current data. JPL's Center for Near-Earth Objects Studies [API \"Fireball\"](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/fireball.html) is an API that will return machine-readable data in the form of a JSON. This notebook will query the Fireball API for data from the last year of observations. The \"last year\" will depend on the year when this notebook is run, so the data is always up to date and relevant\n",

    "Data is requested to the Fireball API via an API key. An API key is a string of numbers and letters that are unique to a specific user. API keys are required to query from an API and often are associated with an hourly limit on how often an API can be query. For NASA API's like Fireball there is an hourly limit of 1000 requests.\n",

For the purposes of this notebook, the API key will be `DEMO_KEY`. `DEMO_KEY` is a valid API key used for lessons and documentation, but has a lower hourly limit of 30 requests per IP address per hour and a total of 50 requests per day. For the purposes of this notebook, replace `DEMO_KEY` with the API key that was generated for you on the [NASA API website](https://api.nasa.gov)\n",
